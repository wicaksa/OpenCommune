        <div className="about-div">The purpose of this project is to provide a web application for users that will allow them to buy, sell, or trade their items. This online platform will allow lenders and borrowers to connect with one another with the hopes of building a stronger community that is more aware of the effects of spending and purchasing new items instead of borrowing or buying secondhand. The main goal for this project is to decrease the amount of purchases made on new items which will save users money and save the environment of finite resources.
